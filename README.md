# AI-Powered-Bot-for-Summarization

1. To create a prototype of an AI-powered summarization bot,
2. we can use the Hugging Face's Transformers library,
3. which provides pre-trained models for natural language processing tasks.

In this case, we'll use a pre-trained model for text summarization.
We'll use the BartForConditionalGeneration model which is designed for text summarization tasks.

# First, you'll need to install the transformers library:
pip install transformers

# We define a SummarizationBot class that uses the BART model for summarization.

# The generate_summary method takes a text input (the startup application in this case) and returns a concise summary.
